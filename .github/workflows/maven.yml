# Name of the workflow as it appears in the GitHub Actions UI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "dev" ] # Triggers the workflow on pushes to the 'main' and 'develop' branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main", "dev" ] # Triggers the workflow on pull requests targeting 'main' and 'develop'

# Defines a single job in the workflow
jobs:
  build_and_test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # You can also use windows-latest or macos-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Action to check out your repository code

    - name: Set up JDK 17

        java-version: '17' # Specify the Java version matching your project
        distribution: 'temurin' # Recommended distribution
        cache: maven # Caches Maven dependencies to speed up builds

    - name: Build Project and Run Integration Tests
      # This step will:
      # - Clean the project (mvn clean)
      # - Install dependencies and compile code (mvn install)
      # - Run all TestNG tests (mvn install automatically runs tests if configured via surefire/failsafe plugins)
      # TestNG tests are typically considered integration tests in an API automation context.
      run: mvn -B clean install

    - name: Upload Test Reports (ExtentReports)
      # This step uploads the generated ExtentReports HTML files as an artifact.
      # This allows you to download and view the reports directly from the GitHub Actions run.
